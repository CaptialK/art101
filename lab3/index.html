		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure .... wow so fun</h1>
		<p id=part1> Im suppose to write something about how I learned about file structures in HTML and mainly in coding
			It was fun and I really like the CSS part of it where you can play with website design

		</p>

<h2> Challenges </h2>

<p> Making a file structure for the lab was rather intresting, adding an image is something that I still struggle with as it sometimes
	does not work. This make me very frustrated with coding but at the same time it is very rewarding when you solve a problem in the code.

</p>

<h2> Results </h2>
<p>
	Here is what I made, this is the webpage and below is an image of the files but i cant find a way to make them extended out expect for on the side bar.
