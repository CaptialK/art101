		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p> Working with my partner Claire and leanring about basic JavaScript data types and variables. </p>
		<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p> One challenge was figuring out how to make the JavaScript work at first I used the = sign in js and nothing worked but I had to use the : sign instead.  </p>
		<h4>Problems</h4>
		<p>
			Problems were linking javascript to the html.index, I had a hard time figuring out how to do the Script Output.
			<br>
			The first example code for the js didn't work at first as the eaxmple gave "\t" but it should have been "/t
		</p>
 		<h5>Results</h5>
		<p> The results are viewable in the webpage where HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used together, also exicted to see how Javascript links can be used as ways to have text popup </p>
