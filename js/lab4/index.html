	<h3> Challenges</h3>
		<p>
			The most challneging part was following the instrcutions on given with the Lab 4 but we made it with help from our wonderful TA. I found that JavaScript part to be redundant with what we're doing in this lab but it probably has more useful applications for website deisgn besides makig list.
		</p>
	<h4> Problems </h4>
		<p>
			I didn't have that many problems with this lab, expect for me still confused as what JavaScript is capable of. I have a hard time keeping my code organized is another problem. I also got to get better at uploading images to html.
		</p>
	<h5> Results </h5>
		<p>
			The results seem good as I did everything that is required of me for this lab. I also spent quite a bit of time on the CSS part which is rather fun and cool to play around with.
